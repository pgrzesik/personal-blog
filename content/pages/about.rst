Hello!

Who I am and what I do
======================

I'm a software developer, currently working at `Pragmatic Coders <http://pragmaticcoders.com/>`.
While mostly using Python as my language of choice, I sometimes write a little bit of JavaScript and Solidity.
I also know a thing or two about Amazon Web Services.

In addition to that, I'm co-organising meetups of `Pykonik, Krakow Python User Group <https://www.meetup.com/Pykonik/>`.

My talks
========
1. (Polish) `Python a architektura Serverless w chmurze AWS <http://slides.com/progressive/deck#/>`
2. (Polish) `Środowiska wirtualne i zarządzanie zależnosciami w Pythonie <http://slides.com/progressive/venvs#/>`
3. (Polish) `Nauka programowania z Free Code Camp <http://slides.com/progressive/deck-2#/>`

About this blog
===============

On this blog I want to share my experiences and opinions on programming related topics.
You can expect posts about Python, Web Development, Blockchain(mostly Ethereum) and serverless architecture

Since English isn't my first language, I'm also hoping to brush up my language skills.
