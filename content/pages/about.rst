Who I am and what I do
======================

I'm a software developer, currently working at `Pragmatic Coders <http://pragmaticcoders.com/>`_.
While mostly using Python as my language of choice, I sometimes write a little bit of JavaScript and Solidity.
I also know a thing or two about Amazon Web Services.

In addition to that, I'm co-organising meetups of `Pykonik, Krakow Python User Group <https://www.meetup.com/Pykonik/>`_.

My talks
========
1. (Polish) `Python a architektura Serverless w chmurze AWS <http://slides.com/progressive/deck#/>`_
2. (Polish) `Środowiska wirtualne i zarządzanie zależnosciami w Pythonie <http://slides.com/progressive/venvs#/>`_
3. (Polish) `Nauka programowania z Free Code Camp <http://slides.com/progressive/deck-2#/>`_

About this blog
===============

On this blog I want to share my experiences and opinions on programming related topics.
You can expect posts about Python, Web Development, Blockchain, mostly Ethereum, serverless architecture and more! :)

Since English isn't my first language, I'm also hoping to brush up my language skills.
